Super Cool Password Picker!

Introduction:
This repository was an attempt to create a password generator using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. To do this I had the option to use java scripts windows prompt, confirm, or use java script to creat box pop ups useing forms which turned out to be a bit more challengeing than expected but defininelty more athletically pleasing. Throughout the the course of the process I used forms, querys, and functions.

Motivation:
Cyber security is constantly evlolving and with it those that are trying to compromise it. Every year corporations and individuals loose billions of dollars anually due to to breachs in cyber security. One of the most basic and easy steps one can tag to improve their security is make a strong password. The best are randomized using a variety of randomly choosen different character types which are long in length. Because I myself personly don't want to be a victim of cyber crime nor do others, I thought it would be a gooed idea to creat a password generator.

Development:
To begin I took to pen and paper to sketch out how I wanted my webpages password generator to look. Next I started on the pre filled html files and used thier containers to build two seperate pop up windows- one for character length and the other for character types. After this initialization I got to work on java script. To begin I wanted to trasition my pop-ups to initially be out of sight then appear replacing the starting screen. I wrote a function that would switch the display properties betewen none and flex.

The next part is where it got challangeing. after usig using queries to give variables for all my elements in javascript. I tried useing functions to gather the stored response vairable from the forms in order to randomize the password based off the selected criteria. I think I got ,close because I was able to change the text asscociated with the card the starting card body.

For resources I used a few youtube few youtube on both password generators and how to creat form pop ups. I think the issue is that I odnt know how to propely store the information from multiple forms in a centralized function. I will be diligently working to solve this.

I did reference the code alot from the bottom video.
